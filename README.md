# Complex Systems Simulation for River networks

Code and presentation slides of Group 3

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

All code is written and tested in [Python3.7.3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
All packages and their used versions needed to run the scripts can be found in requirements.txt. The requirements file can be installed by using the following statement in the terminal;

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Structure

The code used to simulate rivers and animate the results can be found in the files CA_FINAL.py and animate.py. Making grading easier, the same code is combined in a notebook. This notebook is called CSS_group_3.ipynb. 

The emerged networks are analysed using a seperate notebook. This notebook is called network_analysis_group_3.ipynb
